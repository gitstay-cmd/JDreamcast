# JDreamcast

JDreamcast is a work in progress emulator with a goal of
properly emulating the Sega Dreamcast system. Currently written in C.

Eventually this project will also hopefully serve as a documentation hub with
some sort of explanation for the more complicated parts of the Sega Dreamcast,
including the graphics subsytem.
